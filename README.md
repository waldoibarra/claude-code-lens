# Lens

A calmer Claude Code transcript: tool runs fold to one line, errors read in plain words, and
nothing Claude sees changes.

A long turn in Claude Code is mostly tool calls: every read, command and edit gets its rows, and
the reply you care about sits between them. Lens redraws the transcript so you can follow what
Claude did and what it said, and opens the detail only when you click.

## Before and after

The same turn: Claude reads two files and runs the tests, which fail.

**Without Lens** (`/lens raw` shows Claude Code's own drawing):

```text
> run the tests

● I'll check the config, then run the tests.

● Read(src/config.ts)
  ⎿  Read 34 lines

● Read(package.json)
  ⎿  Read 41 lines

● Bash(npm run tset -- --coverage)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1
     npm ERR! Missing script: "tset"
     npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
     npm ERR!     /Users/you/.npm/_logs/2026-10-08T15_22_04_118Z-debug-0.log
```

**Normal**, the default: one count line per run, and each step with the one fact that matters.

```text
> run the tests
                                                                You · 10:22

I'll check the config, then run the tests.
                                                           Opus 5.5 · 10:22
• Read 2 files, ran 1 command (1 failed)
  ✓ Read config.ts · 34 lines
  ✓ Read package.json · 41 lines
  ✗ Run the tests · exit 1
    The command failed (exit 1). Press Ctrl+O to see its output.
    npm ERR! Missing script: "tset"
                                                    Opus 5.5 · 10:22 (gray)
```

**Clean** (`/lens clean`), the lean option: a step count per run and only what went wrong. Use
it when you want to read Claude's replies without distractions.

```text
> run the tests
                                                                You · 10:22

I'll check the config, then run the tests.
                                                           Opus 5.5 · 10:22
▸ 3 steps · 1 failed
  ✗ The command failed (exit 1). Press Ctrl+O to see its output.
                                                    Opus 5.5 · 10:22 (gray)
```

Click a step and it opens in place: the command in a box with its full output under it, or the
diff of an edit.

## Install

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add waldoibarra/claude-code-lens
claude plugin install lens@claude-code-lens
```

Start a new Claude Code session, or run `/reload-plugins` in an open one. Lens starts in the normal
view; type `/lens` to check it loaded.

Lens needs Claude Code's function-hook plugin API, which is early access and tested on Claude Code
2.1.293. If `/lens` is not a known command after installing, update Claude Code with
`claude update` and try again.

## What you get

- **Three views, one command:** normal by default; `/lens clean` strips the transcript to replies
  and failures for distraction-free reading; `/lens raw` shows Claude Code's own drawing. Each
  redraws the whole transcript, earlier turns included.
- **Folded runs:** each group of back-to-back tool calls becomes one line with counts. Long runs
  show 5 steps and a `+N more` you can click.
- **Plain labels:** `Run the tests` and `Edited README.md`, never the raw command, the full path or
  a tool call ID.
- **Plain errors:** raw errors become one line that says what happened and what to do, across 15
  kinds of failure.
- **Click to open:** commands show what ran and the full output, edits show their diff, and failed
  steps show the full error.
- **Message labels:** your prompts and Claude's replies get a right-aligned label with the time and,
  for replies, the model that wrote them, so a `/model` switch is visible where it happened.
- **Answered questions:** a question Claude asked folds to one line; click it to see the question
  and your answer.
- **A working line:** while a step runs, the spinner names it.
- **Sub-agents:** a delegated step shows the model the agent ran on.

Read [Views](/docs/views.md) before picking a view; it shows each one and lists every error line.

## Nothing is lost

- Claude reads exactly what it read before. Lens changes the drawing, never the conversation, the
  transcript file or what is sent to the model.
- **Ctrl+O** still opens the full transcript, and `/lens raw` turns Lens off for the screen at any
  time.
- The plugin makes no model calls and adds nothing to your usage.

## Notes

- Lens is built for the fullscreen interface (`/tui fullscreen`), where clicks work.
- Turns from before Lens loaded show one plain line per step, without folds or timestamps.
- Clicking outside Lens's lines selects the row with a gray highlight. That is Claude Code's own
  behavior and a plugin cannot turn it off.

Read [How it works](/docs/how-it-works.md) before relying on Lens in an unusual setup; it covers
what Lens records and every known limit. Read [Development](/docs/development.md) before changing
the plugin.
