# Development

## Set up

You need [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) and Claude Code installed. From the repository root:

```sh
just setup
```

`just setup` installs the toolchain with mise, TypeScript and Prettier with Bun, Claude Code's
plugin types, and the Git hooks. Read [Toolchain](/docs/toolchain.md) before adding or replacing a
tool.

The plugin types are written by Claude Code, not committed. `just install-types` loads this folder
as a plugin once (`claude --plugin-dir . -p "/lens"`), which makes Claude Code write its API
declarations into `.claude-plugin/types/`. Run it again after updating Claude Code, so
`just typecheck` checks against the API you run.

## Commands

```sh
just dev         # start Claude Code with this working tree loaded as the plugin
just test        # run the tests against Claude Code's own engine
just validate    # check the manifests and hooks module as Claude Code loads them
just typecheck   # strict tsc over hooks, types and tests
just lint        # editorconfig, Markdown and Prettier checks
just format      # format TypeScript, JSON and YAML with Prettier
just check       # every check the Git hooks run
```

## Try a change

`just dev` starts Claude Code with the working tree loaded through `--plugin-dir`. Saving a file
reloads the plugin; a save made during a turn reloads when the turn ends. Saved state such as the
current view survives the reload.

If Lens is also installed from the marketplace, disable it for the session
(`claude plugin disable lens@claude-code-lens`) so two copies do not draw at once, and enable it
again afterwards.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `hooks/register.tsx` | The hooks module: recording steps, drawing each view, the `/lens` command |
| `hooks/lens.ts` | Pure functions: labels, error lines, counts, facts, diffs, output, timestamps |
| `types/index.d.ts` | The state contract: every value Lens keeps in Claude Code's session state |
| `tests/lens.test.ts` | Tests for the pure functions |
| `tests/render.test.tsx` | Tests that drive the hooks through Claude Code's engine and read the drawing |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | The plugin manifest |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Makes this repository a marketplace listing the plugin |

Logic that needs no `$` belongs in `hooks/lens.ts`, where a plain unit test covers it. A function
in `hooks/register.tsx` that takes `$` must be declared at the top level of the file;
`claude plugin validate` rejects a `$` passed to a nested function.

The full plugin API is in `.claude-plugin/types/claude-code/index.d.ts` once types are installed.
Search it for the event or component at hand, such as `'tool.call'` or `ToolGroup: {`.

## Tests

`claude plugin test` runs each `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` file in an environment like the
plugin's own, with Claude Code's engine as `$`. The tests answer the engine's side themselves:
they run tool calls through the plugin, mount a component on the terminal or desktop surface, press
its buttons, and read the drawn tree. They never start a Claude session or call a model.

## Release

Users get a new version when its `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` changes. Never move a
published tag; cut a new patch version instead.

1. Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: patch for fixes and docs, minor for new
   behavior, major for breaking changes.
2. Commit it as `chore: release vX.Y.Z`.
3. Tag the commit: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "<one-line summary>"`.
4. Push both: `git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. Confirm CI passes on the tagged commit.
6. Publish a GitHub Release for the tag with short notes: what changed and whether upgrading needs
   any action.

Installed copies update with `claude plugin marketplace update claude-code-lens`, then
`claude plugin update lens@claude-code-lens`, or on their own when the marketplace is added with
auto-update on.
