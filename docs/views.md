# Views

Lens draws the Claude Code transcript in one of three views. Switch with `/lens`:

```text
/lens normal   # the default: one count line per run, each step with one fact
/lens clean    # one short line per run, nothing else
/lens raw      # Claude Code's own drawing, untouched
```

`/lens` with no argument prints the current view. The view applies to the whole transcript at
once, including turns drawn before the switch, and resets to `normal` in each new session.

A **run** is a group of tool calls Claude makes back to back, with no reply text between them. A
turn that reads two files, says something, then runs a command has two runs.

## Normal

```text
I'll check the config, then run the tests.
                                                           Opus 5.5 · 10:22
• Read 2 files, ran 1 command (1 failed)
  ✓ Read config.ts · 34 lines
  ✓ Read package.json · 41 lines
  ✗ Run the tests · exit 1
    The command failed (exit 1). Press Ctrl+O to see its output.
    npm ERR! Missing script: "tset"
                                                    Opus 5.5 · 10:22 (gray)
```

- The count line totals each kind of step: files read, files changed, commands, searches, web
  lookups, delegated tasks, skills and integrations.
- Each step shows a plain label and one fact from its result: `exit 0`, `34 lines`, `+2 −1 lines`,
  the sub-agent's model and duration, or a web page's domain. A fact the result does not carry is
  left off.
- A run shows its first 5 steps. Click `+N more` to show the rest and `show fewer` to go back.
- A failed step adds a plain line saying what happened and what to do, then the raw error's first
  line in gray, with paths shortened to the file name.

## Clean

The lean view, for reading Claude's replies without distractions.

```text
I'll check the config, then run the tests.
                                                           Opus 5.5 · 10:22
▸ 3 steps · 1 failed
  ✗ The command failed (exit 1). Press Ctrl+O to see its output.
                                                    Opus 5.5 · 10:22 (gray)
```

- Each run is one line: the number of steps and the number that failed.
- Only the run's most recent failure shows, as one red line.
- Click the line to list the step names. A sub-agent step also names its model.

## Raw

Claude Code draws everything itself. Lens adds no labels and folds nothing. Use it to see a turn
exactly as Claude Code shows it without Lens.

## What every view except raw adds

- **Message labels:** a right-aligned line under each message: `You · 10:20` under your prompts,
  the replying model under each block of Claude's reply (`Opus 5.5 · 10:22`), and a gray label
  under each run with the model that called its steps and the time the run started. The model is
  read per reply, so a `/model` switch shows on the next reply. Claude Code's `●` bullet is
  dropped, since the label marks each message.
- **Plain step labels:** a step reads `Run the tests`, `Edited README.md` or `Delegated: Find
  usages`, never the raw command, the full path, or a tool call ID. Commands use the description
  Claude gave them.
- **Plain errors:** raw errors become one line that says what happened and what to do. See
  [Error lines](#error-lines).
- **Click to open a step:** an edit opens its diff, a command opens its command in a bordered box
  with the full output under it, and a failed step opens its full error text. Click again to close.
- **Answered questions:** a question Claude asked you folds to one line, such as `? Answered Scope:
  User`. Click it to see each question and your answer.
- **Working line:** while a step runs, the spinner shows its label instead of a random verb.
- **Background agents:** the "Agent … finished" row ends with the agent's model and finish time.

## Error lines

| The raw error mentions | Lens shows |
| --- | --- |
| A step you declined | You declined this step. Tell Claude how to proceed. |
| An interruption | Stopped by you. Send a message to continue. |
| A file not read before editing | Claude must read the file before changing it. It will retry. |
| Text to replace not found | The text to change was not found. Claude should re-read the file. |
| Text to replace found more than once | The text to change appears more than once. Claude should give more context. |
| `ENOENT`, no such file | File or folder not found. Check the name, or ask Claude to search for it. |
| `EACCES`, permission denied | Permission denied. Check file permissions or run with access. |
| Command not found | A required program is not installed. Install it or ask for another way. |
| A timeout | The step timed out. Retry it, or run it in the background. |
| `429`, rate limit | Rate limited. Wait a moment, then retry. |
| Connection refused, DNS failure | Network request failed. Check the connection or the address. |
| `401`, `403` | Access was refused. Sign in again or check credentials. |
| `404` | Not found. Check the name or address. |
| An exit code | The command failed (exit N). Press Ctrl+O to see its output. |
| A syntax error | A syntax error stopped the step. Claude should fix the code and retry. |
| Anything else | The step failed. Press Ctrl+O to see the details. |

A failed slash command's output is relabeled the same way.

## Full detail

- **Ctrl+O** opens Claude Code's full transcript, which Lens leaves untouched.
- **`/lens raw`** shows the whole transcript without Lens.
- Clicking a step shows up to 2,000 lines or 20,000 characters of output. Longer output ends with a
  line pointing to Ctrl+O.

Read [How it works](/docs/how-it-works.md) before relying on Ctrl+O, timestamps or clicks in an
unusual setup.
